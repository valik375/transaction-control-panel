# Transactions Management Dashboard

Mock streaming-service billing dashboard for reviewing transaction history, downloading invoices, and retrying failed payments in bulk.

The assignment is intentionally small, so I treated the interesting part as product-quality execution: clear state transitions, visible per-row feedback, a polished table UI, and enough tests to make the concurrent retry behavior safe to change during an interview.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How I Work With AI

I use AI as a structured engineering partner, not as an autopilot. My goal is to make the work more deliberate: design first, implementation second, verification always.

1. **Start with system design through Ralplan** - I begin with the requirements and run a Ralplan workflow, where separate AI roles such as an analytic planner, critic, and architect challenge the direction until there is a practical consensus. This helps reduce the confirmation bias that can happen when one assistant in one chat starts agreeing too easily with the original idea.
2. **Create the design artifact first** - The first durable output is a system design document. For this project, that is `SYSTEM-DESIGN.md`; it describes the feature boundaries, state model, data flow, tradeoffs, and test strategy before implementation starts.
3. **Implement from the design** - After the design is clear enough, I build the first version in small slices: transaction model, mock data retrieval, retry simulation, invoice generation, dashboard UI, activity feedback, tests, and polish.
4. **Add guardrails after the first version** - Once the app exists, I tighten it with tests, linting, project-specific scripts, and architecture checks. The file-size script is especially important because it stops AI-assisted work from drifting into long, hard-to-review files.
5. **Iterate against the design** - I keep comparing the implementation back to the system design and adjust both until the code, docs, tests, and product behavior match the intended shape.

## Requirements Coverage

All core requirements are implemented:

- Next.js React project with TypeScript.
- Payment history page showing transaction ID, amount, date/time, status, payment method, and invoice action.
- Mock data includes past transactions with a `Failed` status.
- Failed rows support row-level selection and a header checkbox that selects all retry-eligible failed transactions.
- Per-transaction `Download invoice` action.
- Invoice download simulates a 2-second PDF generation state before triggering a browser download of a dummy PDF.
- Download completion is acknowledged inline in the table, close to the transaction that caused it.
- Bulk selection ignores successful rows and rows that are already retrying.
- `Retry selected` action supports bulk retry of failed payments.
- Selected retries are started concurrently.
- Each retrying row has its own independent loading state.
- Each row resolves independently after a random 1-4 second delay.
- Retry simulation uses an 80% success / 20% failure outcome.
- The table supports sorting for `Amount`, `Date and time`, and `Status` only.
- Sort cycle is `descending` on first click, `ascending` on second click, and back to default order on third click.
- A compact activity log narrates retry batches, individual retry outcomes, and invoice generation/download results.

## Architecture

The app uses a small vertical-slice structure around `modules/transactions-dashboard`. The route layer stays thin: `app/page.tsx` renders the server-safe page, loads mock transactions, and passes serializable data into a narrow client workflow island.

Inside the feature:

- `model/` contains the pure dashboard state, bulk-selection selectors, sorting rules, transaction contracts, retry policy, invoice helpers, and activity messages.
- `commands/transactions-dashboard-actions.ts` is the injected command boundary, so the UI does not care whether retry and invoice work is mock code, a Route Handler, or a real backend.
- `ui/` is grouped by responsibility: server dashboard shell, client workflow island, payment history table, activity callout, summary cards, theme toggle, and page wrapper.
- `api/get-transactions.ts` represents initial server-side data retrieval.

The riskiest behavior is concurrent retry state, so `dashboard-state.ts` keeps selection, retrying rows, reset, and summary logic in a pure reducer. Bulk failed-selection state is derived from reducer-backed selectors rather than ad hoc table logic. Sorting lives beside the model in `transactions-sorting.ts`, while browser-only workflow state in `use-transactions-dashboard.ts` coordinates header selection state, active sort mode, row feedback, activity updates, and invoice/retry command flow.

Tests focus on reducer behavior, retry/invoice timing, component interactions, and theme flash prevention. The longer tradeoffs and data-flow notes are in `SYSTEM-DESIGN.md`.

## Data Flow

Initial render:

```text
Browser requests /
  |
  +- app/page.tsx renders TransactionsPage
  |
  +- getTransactions()
  |    |
  |    +- returns realistic mock payment history
  |
  +- server dashboard shell receives initial transactions
  |
  +- reducer initializes:
       transactions, selectedIds = [], retryingIds = []
  |
  +- table renders history, failed-row checkboxes, invoice buttons, summary cards
```

Header bulk select:

```text
Header checkbox clicked
  |
  +- reducer-backed eligibility rules collect failed, non-retrying rows
  +- all eligible failed rows are selected or cleared together
  +- row identity stays keyed by transaction id
```

Batch retry:

```text
User selects failed rows
  |
  +- reducer toggles selectedIds
  |
  +- Retry selected clicked
  |
  +- reducer marks selected IDs as retrying and clears selection
  +- activity log records the retry batch start
  |
  +- retryPayment(id) starts for every selected row immediately
  |    |
  |    +- random delay between 1 and 4 seconds
  |    +- random outcome: 80% Success, 20% Failed
  |
  +- each promise resolves independently
       |
       +- reducer updates only that transaction
       +- row leaves loading state
       +- inline result becomes "Retry recovered" or "Retry failed"
       +- activity log records that row's outcome
```

Invoice download:

```text
Download invoice clicked
  |
  +- row enters "Generating" state
  |
  +- activity log records invoice generation
  |
  +- wait 2 seconds
  |
  +- create dummy application/pdf Blob
  |
  +- create object URL and trigger hidden anchor download
  |
  +- revoke object URL
  |
  +- row shows "Invoice INV-... downloaded"
  +- activity log records the download result
```

Sorting:

```text
Sortable header clicked
  |
  +- hook updates sort mode: descending -> ascending -> default
  +- sorted view order changes for Amount, Date and time, or Status
  +- transaction identity, selection, retry, and invoice state stay keyed by id
```

## Tests

```bash
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript strict-mode check
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run check:file-size # Guard against oversized files
npm run test        # Vitest unit/component tests
npm run build       # Production build
npm run verify      # file-size + typecheck + lint + test + build
```

`npm run verify` is the main pre-submission command. The file-size check follows the same rule as the chat codebase: split large source files instead of hiding complex behavior in one oversized module. `SYSTEM-DESIGN.md` is the deeper reference when you need the full reasoning behind the reducer, sorting model, and async workflow choices.
