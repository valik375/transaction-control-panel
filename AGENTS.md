# Agent skills

## Testing

Use this skill when writing, reviewing, or refactoring tests in this take-home
project. It covers Vitest model/component tests, React Testing Library
interactions, injected dashboard actions, invoice
download simulation, concurrent retry behavior, activity popover behavior, and
theme flash prevention.

See `.agents/skills/testing/SKILL.md`.

# How to verify

- Run `npm run check:file-size` after moving or splitting files.
- Run targeted Vitest for the changed area while iterating.
- Run `npm run verify` before claiming the project is ready.
