# Testing Skill

## Purpose

Use this skill to test the take-home `test/` project: a Next.js Transactions Management Dashboard for reviewing payment history, downloading invoices, and retrying failed payments in bulk.

The project is small on purpose. Tests should make it look professional: precise, behavior-focused, deterministic, and easy to explain during an interview.

## Always do this

1. Identify the user-visible behavior or architecture boundary being protected.
2. Choose the smallest honest test level:
   - model/unit
   - component
   - static architecture check
3. Use existing seams before inventing new ones:
   - pure model functions in `modules/transactions-dashboard/model`
   - injected `TransactionsDashboardActions`
   - `createMockTransactionsDashboardActions`
   - React Testing Library with `userEvent`
4. Assert observable behavior, not component internals.
5. Keep async tests deterministic: use deferred promises, fake timers, mocked randomness, or accessible state.
6. Run the narrowest useful check first, then `npm run verify`.
7. Use `npm run check:file-size` when refactoring files so the take-home stays small and reviewable.

## Hard constraints

- Read relevant Next.js docs from `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before changing Next App Router code.
- Do not add new test libraries unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not use real network calls.
- Do not test implementation details such as hook call order, reducer internals from component tests, or Radix internals.
- Do not use arbitrary sleeps as a synchronization strategy.
- Do not snapshot the whole dashboard as a substitute for behavior assertions.
- Do not hide async behavior behind `Promise.all` in tests when the product requirement is independent row resolution.
- Do not call the injected command boundary a "port" in this project. Use `actions`, `commands`, or `command boundary`.
- Do not add file-size exceptions for ordinary source files. Split the file at a useful boundary.

## Test level decision

Use model/unit tests for pure behavior:

- reducer transitions in `dashboard-state.ts`
- retry delay and success/failure policy in `retry-payment.ts`
- invoice Blob contents, file naming, and generation delay in `invoice-download.ts`
- activity message builders in `activity-log.ts` if copy or tone mapping becomes risky

Use component tests for browser-like UI behavior without a real browser:

- failed-row selection
- retry button enable/disable behavior
- concurrent retry state with per-row spinners
- out-of-order retry resolution
- invoice generation state and inline feedback
- reset behavior
- action injection through `TransactionsDashboardActions`

Use static architecture checks sparingly for rules that are easy to regress:

- `layout.tsx` should render `ThemeSyncScript`, not contain the raw sync script.
- feature UI should receive `actions`, not import mock retry/download implementations directly.
- dashboard public imports should go through `index.server`, `index.client`, or feature-local paths as appropriate.

## Project-specific patterns

Component tests should render the client workflow island directly. The server
dashboard shell is intentionally thin and does not accept injected actions:

```tsx
function renderDashboard(ui: React.ReactElement) {
  return render(ui)
}
```

Use deferred promises to prove independent async row updates:

```tsx
const retryById = new Map<string, ReturnType<typeof deferred<RetryPaymentResult>>>()
const retryPayment = vi.fn((transactionId: string) => {
  const retry = deferred<RetryPaymentResult>()
  retryById.set(transactionId, retry)
  return retry.promise
})
```

Inject actions instead of importing mock command implementations into tests:

```tsx
<TransactionsDashboardClient
  initialTransactions={listMockTransactions()}
  actions={createMockTransactionsDashboardActions({ retryPayment })}
/>
```

## Output contract

When generating or reviewing tests, use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

```text
Behavior to protect:
- ...

Recommended test level:
- model/unit | component | static architecture check

Seam/double to use:
- ...

Tests:
<code or file edits>

Why this is resilient:
- ...

Failure meaning:
- What user-visible behavior or boundary would be broken.

Repo checks to run:
- npm run test -- <target>
- npm run check:file-size
- npm run verify
```

Keep explanations short by default.

## Failure behavior

If behavior is unclear, write a small behavior matrix before editing tests.

If the test would require a missing seam, suggest the smallest production-code refactor. In this project that usually means injecting an action or moving pure logic into `model/`.

If a test becomes flaky, first remove sleeps and hidden real time. Use fake timers, controlled promises, or accessible state.

If the user asks for broad "coverage", prioritize the business risks: concurrent retries, invoice generation/download, theme flash prevention, and accessible popover behavior.
